# CurseOfTheFourLords
Curse of the Four Lords is a 2D RPG clone that I made as my first major project. It comes with a short and sweet action experience
for those who enjoy something quick and easy.
Coded entirely in Java.

The game includes:

Original story developed by yours truly.

Original artwork.

Four distinguishable NPCs.

Multiple bosses, all equipped with their own cutscenes.

Classic RPG elements.

Supported on Windows and Windows 64.
